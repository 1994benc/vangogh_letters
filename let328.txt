Schenkweg 14 March.

Dear Mr de Zwart,
    Last Monday1 I paid Giesenberg2 not only the 4.603 guilders due that day but also a further 10 guilders.
In accordance with the matter dealt with in my letter of last month with regard to the attic room.4
May I now count on your kind consideration in respect of fitting it up efficiently?
Otherwise leaving it to you, naturally, to decide how you want to do it.
I respectfully remain,

Your servant
Vincent van Gogh. 2r:2
