Arles, 31 May 1889.

Dear Mr Vincent,
We were very pleased to learn that you are doing well and that the air of St-Rémy has done you good.
We understand that you are feeling well, and that the surroundings of your new residence, which is only temporary, will distract you and provide subjects for your art.
I have had a fine frame made as we had agreed, in walnut and impeccable.1 I delivered it to the bursar.2
I have told everyone who knows you how you are, and everyone was glad to learn that you are in good health, and we hope to have the pleasure of seeing you soon, in anticipation of which Mrs Ginoux and I send you our best regards.

Joseph Ginoux.
