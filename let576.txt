Dear Sir,
If you come on my behalf you will find at Cluzel’s, the framer in rue Fontaine,1 a painting that I have delivered for you (for our exchange).2 If you do not consider it suitable, let me know, and come and choose yourself. Forgive me if I do not come to collect your paintings myself, I am so rarely in your part of town.3 I shall collect them from 19 boulevard Montmartre4 if you will be so kind as to leave them there.

Yours,
Paul Gauguin
