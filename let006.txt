[Letterhead: Goupil The Hague]

The Hague, 24 March 1873

My dear Theo,
Would you mind checking whether a painting by Schotel is still in Brussels?
    It was sent from here on consignment on 6 May 1870, but perhaps Uncle has already sent it back to Paris.
If that isn’t the case, however, see that it’s sent here immediately. 
 1v:2  We have every chance of selling it, but time is of the essence.1
I saw it last summer in your gallery,2 and imagine it’s probably still there.
Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt3 and Mr Schmidt and Eduard for me.4
You’ll have received my letter by now.5 Adieu, I wish you well.

Vincent
