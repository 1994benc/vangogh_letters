London, 16 June 1874

My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter.
I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday, 25 or Saturday, 27 June, if nothing unforeseen happens.1 I’m longing so much to see everyone and Holland. I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art, start thinking about any questions you might want to put to me.
We have many beautiful things here, including a spirited painting by Jacquet, and a beautiful Boldini.2
 1v:2 
There are beautiful things at the Royal Academy this year; among others Tissot has 3 paintings.3
I’ve been drawing again recently, but it was nothing special.4
I was glad to see in your letter that you visit the Haanebeeks.
    Adieu, goodbye for now, give my regards to all my friends. Ever,

Your brother.
Vincent.

I’m glad you like César de Cock so much; he’s one of the few painters to have understood our Brabant intimately enough.5 I don’t know whether I told you that I met him last year in Paris.6
