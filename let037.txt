Paris, 6 July 1875

My dear Theo,
Thanks for writing, yes, old boy, I thought so. You must write and tell me sometime how your English is, have you done anything about it? If not, it’s not such a great disaster.
I’ve rented a small room in Montmartre which you’d like; it’s small, but overlooks a little garden full of ivy and Virginia creeper.1
I want to tell you which prints I have on the wall.


  
    Ruisdael 
     
    The bush2
  
  
    ditto
     
    Bleaching fields3

    Reading the Bible (a large, old Dutch room, (in the evening, a candle on the table) in which a young mother sits beside her child’s cradle reading the Bible; an old woman listens,4 it’s something that recalls: Verily I say unto you,5 ‘for where 2 or 3 are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them’,6 it’s an old copper engraving, as large as ‘The bush’, superb).
  
  
    P. de Champaigne
     
    Portrait of a lady7
