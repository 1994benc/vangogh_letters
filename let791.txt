Arles, 16 July 1889.

Sir,
I have made enquiries in Paris about the book you ordered from me1 and they replied that it was out of print. If you want another volume, please give me the title, and I shall send it to you forthwith; if not, I shall return your money on your next visit to me. Yours faithfully,

    H. Lamblot successor to A. Jauffret.2 1v:2
