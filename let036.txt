[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

Paris, 29 June 1875

My dear Theo,
I’d rather that you were out of The Hague.1 Don’t you sometimes long for that as well? Write and tell me, yes or no?
I’m staying here for the time being, and will probably not go to Holland before the autumn.
In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find a package for Helvoirt. Please send it on after looking at what’s inside. There are a few lithographs &c. which I’d like to see in Pa’s study with the ‘Funeral in the cornfield’ by Van der Maaten.2 Anker’s painting of ‘An old Huguenot’, a photo of which is in the package in question, I sold to Uncle Vincent, who was here a couple of days ago.3 He also bought 
 1r:2  a beautiful painting by Jacque, horses pulling a plough in the rain.4
There was a sale here of drawings by Millet, I don’t know whether I’ve already written to you about it. When I entered the room in Hôtel Drouot where they were exhibited,5 I felt something akin to: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.6 You know that Millet lived in Gréville. Well, I don’t know whether it was Gréville or Granville where the man I once told you about died.7 At any rate, I looked at Millet’s drawings of ‘The cliffs at Gréville’ with redoubled attention.8 A painting of his, ‘The church of Gréville’, is now in the Luxembourg.9
Adieu

Vincent
