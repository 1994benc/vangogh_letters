    Dear Sir,
    I regret that I have been unable to obtain any of the items you specified, since they all fetched more than the prices specified.1
    They were all purchased by Mr Van Stockum, who had apparently been acting on commission.
     1v:2 
    I do not know for whom, but hope to be able to discover it, since I know Mr Van Stockum’s son and he has promised to make enquiries.2
            As soon as I hear anything I shall write informing you.
    The auction was very well attended, and I have heard that in general the prices paid were higher than usual.3
     1v:3 
    Approximately 30 guilders was paid for the nos. specified.
    With the request that you pay my respects to the De Jonge family,4 I am, yours faithfully,
                    
        Your obedient servant
        V.W. van Gogh
