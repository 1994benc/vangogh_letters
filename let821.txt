Sir,
I accept with pleasure your invitation to exhibit with the Vingtistes.1 Here is the list of canvases I intend for you

    Orchard in blossom (Arles)5

    6
    The red vineyard (Montmajour)7
  







 (All these canvases are no. 30 canvases.)

I am perhaps exceeding the 4 metres of room but as I believe that the 6 together, thus chosen, will make a rather varied colour effect, perhaps you will find a way of placing them.
Please accept the expression of my entire fellow-feeling for the Vingtistes.

Vincent van Gogh
