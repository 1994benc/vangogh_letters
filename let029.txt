We’re going to hold an exhibition in April.5 Mr Boussod6 has promised to send us the best that can be had: Malaria by Hébert,7 The cliff by J. Breton, &c.8
I’d like so much to have you here, we must make sure that it happens sometime. I’d like so much to show you my room &c. There’s a beautiful exhibition of old art here,9 including a large Descent from the Cross by Rembrandt, 5 large figures at twilight,10 you can imagine the sentiment. 5 Ruisdaels,11 1 Frans Hals,12 Van Dyck.13 A landscape with figures by Rubens,14 a landscape, an autumn evening, by Titian.15 2 portraits by Tintoretto16 and beautiful old English art, Reynolds, Romney and Old Crome, landscape,17 magnificent.
