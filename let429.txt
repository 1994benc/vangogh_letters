My dear Theo,
Today I sent a parcel to your address containing 3 small panels and 9 watercolours.1 Please let me know whether you’ve received it. If there’s anything in it you like, so much the better. Ma is going on much the same. Am still working on various weavers, which you’ll get later.
Lies has left again,2 it’s a lot of hard work for Wil.
Regards.

Ever yours,
    Vincent 1v:2
