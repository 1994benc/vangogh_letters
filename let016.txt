London, 20 Nov. 1873.

Dearest Caroline,
  I wish you many happy returns;1 it will surely be a festive day, this first birthday in your own house.2 I hope that this will be a very good and happy year for you both.
You’ve received my last letter, I hope. Write soon with news of how everyone is doing. I’m longing 
 1v:2  to hear something again.
Have you seen Theo yet? I heard that he arrived in The Hague last Wednesday.
Herewith a small contribution for the album.3
I’m fine, but I’m up to my ears in work, and only have a moment.
Bid good-day to everyone in the Poten;4 how I’d like to look in on you today. I wish you both the best.

Yours truly,
Vincent.
