[Letterhead: Maison de Santé Saint-Rémy]

Dear Sir,
Following your instructions, I am sending you a postal order for 20 francs, the remainder of the amount that I had in my possession.1 I see with pleasure that your health continues to be satisfactory, and that your life in the midst of this world of artists is spent more pleasantly than here.

 I shall be happy to hear of your future successes in the various 
 1v:2  exhibitions in which you will take part.
With my sincerest regards.

Dr T. Peyron
