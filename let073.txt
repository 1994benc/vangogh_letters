[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

Paris, 28 March 1876

My dear Theo,
A few more words, probably the last I’ll write to you from Paris.
I’ll probably leave here on Friday evening to be home on Saturday morning at the same time as at Christmas.1
Yesterday I saw around 6 paintings by Michel,2 how I wish you’d been there, sunken roads through sandy soil leading to a mill, or a man going home over the heath or sandy ground with a grey sky above, so simple and so fine. It seems to me that the pilgrims on their way to Emmaus3 saw nature as Michel does, I always think of them whenever I see one of his paintings.
At the same time I saw a painting by Jules Dupré, 
  1r:2  and a very large one at that.
As far as the eye could see, black marshy terrain, in the middle distance a river and in the foreground a pond (near it 3 horses). Reflected in both, the bank of white and grey clouds behind which the sun has set; on the horizon some greyish red and purple, the upper sky a gentle blue.4
I saw these paintings at Durand-Ruel’s. There they have no fewer than 25 etchings after Millet, and the same number after Michel, and masses after Dupré and Corot and all other artists, to be had for 1 franc apiece. That’s tempting indeed. I couldn’t resist buying a couple after Millet:5 I bought the last 3 of The evening angelus,6 and my brother will of course receive one when the opportunity arises.
I hear that Mr Iterson is coming to live at the Rooses’, he’s the youngest, I believe.7 Write again soon. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and to anyone who might ask after me, and in thought a handshake, and ever

Your loving brother
Vincent.

Adieu!
