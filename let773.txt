Marseille 13 May 1889

Mr Vincent,
If I have delayed in writing to you, I thought I could use my day off to go and see you; as I was not able to come to Arles, I come to ask you for news of your health, are you well recovered since our last conversation?1 You seemed to me disposed to begin your work in earnest again, the countryside is beautiful, you cannot lack for models. You would give me great pleasure if you did me the honour of a reply.
Have you received news of your esteemed brother? As for me, my health is very good. I received a letter from my wife telling me that she is very well, as are Marcelle, Armand and Camille.2 They join me in sending you their respects, and hope 
 1v:2  that my letter finds you in good health. If you have the occasion to see Mr and Mrs Ginoux and the friends Mr and Mrs Bressy,3 Pelissier4 and all the friends who are interested in me, give them my best regards, or tell Mr Ginoux to do it for you.
My dear Mr Vincent, accept the regards of he who declares himself to be your entirely devoted friend
