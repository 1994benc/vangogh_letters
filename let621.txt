My dear Theo —
If Gauguin wants to accept, and if the only obstacle to going into business would be the travel, it’s better not to keep him waiting. So I’ve written, although I hardly had the time, having two canvases on the easel.1 If you think the letter’s clear enough, send it,2 if not, it would be better for us, too, to abstain when in doubt.3 And the things you would do for him shouldn’t upset the plan to bring our sisters over, and especially not our needs, yours and mine. Because if we ourselves don’t keep ourselves in a state of vigour, how can we claim the right to get involved in other people’s troubles? But at present we’re on the way to remaining vigorous, and so let’s do the possible, what’s right in front of us.
I’m sending you enclosed herewith canvas sample for Tasset; however, I don’t 
 1v:2  know if we should go on with his canvas.4
If you send me the5 next letter by Sunday morning, I’ll probably go off to Saintes-Maries again at 1 o’clock that day and spend the week there.6
I’m reading a book about Wagner which I’ll send you afterwards7 — what an artist — one like that in painting, now that would be something. It will come.
Do you know that at


  
    6 rue Coëtlogon, rue de Rennes,
  
  
    on  7 and 8 June from 1 to 7 o’clock
  
  
    there’s an exhibition of paintings and drawings by
  
  
    Régamey
  




that could be very interesting; now there’s two who’ve travelled all over the place, he and his brother.8
Handshake.

Ever yours,
Vincent.


I believe in the victory of Gauguin and other artists — but — between then and now there’s a long time, and even if he had the good fortune to sell one or two canvases — it would be the same story. While waiting, Gauguin could peg out like Meryon, discouraged.9 It’s bad that he’s not working — well, we’ll see his reply.
