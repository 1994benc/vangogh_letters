[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

Paris, 13 August 1875

My dear Theo,
  I had wanted to write to you earlier. I’m glad that Pa has accepted the call to Etten;1 under the circumstances I also think it good that Willemien is going along with Anna.2 I’d also have liked to be with all of you that Sunday at Helvoirt;3 have I already told you that I was with Soek and his family at Ville-d’Avray that day?4 I was surprised to find 3 paintings by Corot in the church there.5
On Sunday last and Sunday a fortnight ago6 I went to Mr Mercier’s7 church and heard him speak on ‘all things work together for good to them that love God’8 (in Dutch it says ‘for those who love God all things will work together for good’) and on ‘He created man in his own image’,9 it was glorious and grand. You should also go to church every Sunday if you can, even if it isn’t so very beautiful; 
 1r:2  do that, you won’t regret it. Have you ever been to hear the Rev. Zubli?10
In the list of what I have hanging in my room I forgot:


  
    N. Maes 
     
    The nativity11 
  
  
    Hamon
     
    ‘If I were sombre winter’12
  
  
    Ed. Frère
     
    The seamstresses13
  
  
    ditto 
     
    A cooper14
  
  
    Français
     
    Last fine day15
  
  
    Ruipérez
     
    The imitation of Jesus Christ16
  
  
    Bosboom
     
    Cantabimus and psallemus17 
  









    
    I’m doing my best to find another engraving of ‘Rembrandt, Reading the Bible’18 for you, perhaps I’ll be sending it to you in the first crate of paintings. Have I sent you a lithograph of Troyon, Morning effect?19 Français, Last fine days?20 If not, write and tell me; I have two of each. And now, I wish you well, do right and don’t look back,21 as much as you can, and believe me ever

Your loving brother
Vincent
