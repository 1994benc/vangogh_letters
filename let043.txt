Paris, 2 Sept. 1875

My dear Borchers,
      Thanks for your letter, which I received this morning and which gave me pleasure. I hope to come to Holland at Christmas and, if I can, immediately to The Hague, and we must then make sure not to miss each other.
      I’m glad that you still have a passion for reading, that’s always good, at least such books as you read. I still keep it up, too; an employee in our office1 who has gone on holiday 
       1v:2  to Holland has just promised to bring me a copy of ‘Motley, Geschiedenis der 17 provinciën’.2
As you know, I’m now in Paris; so I’ve wandered rather a lot since we saw each other on my last day in The Hague,3 and it seems to me that it was a great deal longer than 2 years ago.
Warm regards, give my regards to your Mother and sisters as well,4 and believe me

Ever yours,
V.W. van Gogh
