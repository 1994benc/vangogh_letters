[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]

Paris, 13 Sept. 1875.

My dear Theo,
The photographs of the J. Breton and the Corot are for Helvoirt;1 the rest are for you.
Send on the Helvoirt ones when you have the opportunity, but I’ll do my best to get another copy of the Rembrandt,2 so perhaps it would be better to delay sending them until I’ve sent you that one as well.
You’ll have received my letter of yesterday by now.

Warm regards,
Vt.
